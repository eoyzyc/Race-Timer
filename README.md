# Race-Timer
So basically i do Speed slalom in Inline skating and it is kind of expensive to buy a race timer so i made this.
You would also need a laser to be pointing at the LDR.
Refer to the picture to wire the Board, here i used a Auduino Nano it should work on other boards as well... i think.
Also if anyone sees this also also knows how to program the Raspberry pi pico it would be nice if you can translate it into Python.
